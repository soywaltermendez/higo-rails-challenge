# Higo Rails Starter

## Rails

- Haml for server-rendered HTML
- RSpec, Capybara and FactoryBot for integration testing
- Devise for authentication
- Bootstrap for styling
- ActiveStorage for file storage

## React

If you want to use React, take a look at the bottom of the `cofig/routes.rb` file to enable the front-end routing. This is a simplified setup that is not production ready, but will let you get started quickly.

Don't hesitate to install any alternatives that you prefer or any other dependencies you deem necessary.
